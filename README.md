Even before somebody shouts loudly ‘Java was died’. But is this really the case? In fact, If you often attention to Java in long time, your feel is too deep. Though it's many disadvantages and verbose. It couldn't be denied that Java is still best language in industry member, and advance with the times. This project is a CRUD demo example base Spring Boot with Vue2 + webpack2. I hope pass thought this project for express Java microservice fast full stack base web practice.
